      Lucy the Dog
      Likes: I like to eat human food. My favorite food is eggs.
      Dislikes: I do not like Harry, the other dog that is like my roommate.
      He bullies me, eats my food and sniffs my butt sometimes, which is very rude,
      considering I am much older than him.
      Fun Fact: I am around my late fifties. I also like to go on tumblr sometimes.
      These are My Friends:
